# Deployment Documentation

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* **AWS Account & CLI:** You must have an active AWS account and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) configured with appropriate credentials and permissions to interact with your AWS resources.
* **Terraform Installed:** Ensure that Terraform is installed on your local machine. The version should be compatible with the configurations provided. You can download and install Terraform from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
* **Domain Registrar Access:** Access to the management interface of your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy) is necessary to update Name Server (NS) records for your domains.
* **Parent Domain :** Use Route 53 hosted zone for the parent domain. While the current setup creates separate hosted zones for subdomains or the main domain directly, managing a parent zone simplifies DNS delegation.

## Important Notes

* **Route 53 Zone Creation & Delegation:**
    * Each Terraform module (`aws_backend`, `aws_frontend`) is configured to create its own Route 53 hosted zone based on the `domain_name_api` and `domain_name_app` variables, respectively.
    * After Terraform successfully creates these hosted zones, AWS will provide a unique set of Name Servers (NS) for each zone.
    * It is **crucial** to update the NS records at your domain registrar (or within the DNS management interface of your parent domain's hosted zone) to point to these AWS-provided NS records. This delegation is essential for ACM certificate validation and for ensuring that DNS queries for your domains are correctly resolved to your AWS resources.

## Deployment Steps

Let's use the `integration` environment as an example. Remember to replace `integration` with `staging` or `prod` when deploying to other environments.

1.  **Navigate to the Environment Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd environments/integration
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Apply the Configuration:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve"
    ```

4.  **Obtain Name Server (NS) Records:**

    Once the `terraform apply` command completes successfully, it will output important information, including the Name Servers for the Route 53 hosted zones that have been created. You will typically see outputs similar to the following:

    ```text
    Outputs:

    aws_backend.route53_name_servers_info

    Name servers:
    ns-XXX.awsdns-XX.org.
    ns-YYY.awsdns-YY.net.
    ns-ZZZ.awsdns-ZZ.co.uk.
    ns-AAA.awsdns-AA.com.


    aws_frontend.route53_name_servers_info

    Name servers:
    ns-BBB.awsdns-BB.org.
    ns-CCC.awsdns-CC.net.
    ns-DDD.awsdns-DD.co.uk.
    ns-EEE.awsdns-EE.com.
    ```

5.  **Delegate DNS - CRITICAL STEP:**

    * **For `domain_name_app` (e.g., `app.integration.yuriypikh.site`):**
        * Go to your domain parent hosted zone in Route53. Create NS (Name Server) records for `app.integration.yuriypikh.site` to point to the Name Servers provided in the `aws_frontend.route53_name_servers_info` output for the current environment or copy it directly from Route53.

    * **For `domain_name_api` (e.g., `api.integration.yuriypikh.site`):**
        * Similarly, go to your domain parent hosted zone in Route53. Create NS (Name Server) records for `api.integration.yuriypikh.site` to point to the Name Servers provided in the `aws_backend.route53_name_servers_info` output for the current environment or copy it directly from Route53.

    * **Special Case for `prod` environment (or if `domain_name_app` is a root domain like `yuriypikh.site`):**
        * **Frontend (`domain_name_app = "yuriypikh.site"`):**
            * Go to your domain registrar where `yuriypikh.site` is registered.
            * Change the existing Name Server records for `yuriypikh.site` to use the NS records output by `aws_frontend.route53_name_servers_info` for the `prod` environment.
        * **Backend (`domain_name_api = "api.yuriypikh.site"`):**
            * The `aws_backend` module has created a separate hosted zone specifically for `api.yuriypikh.site`.
            * You need to delegate the `api` subdomain from the `yuriypikh.site` zone, which is now managed by Route 53 due to the `aws_frontend` module's deployment in the `prod` environment.
            * In the AWS Route 53 console, find the hosted zone for `yuriypikh.site`.
            * Create a new record set with the following details:
                * **Name:** `api`
                * **Type:** `NS - Name server`
                * **Value:** The list of 4 Name Servers provided by `aws_backend.route53_name_servers_info` for the `prod` environment.
                * **TTL:** Use a reasonable Time-To-Live value (e.g., `172800` seconds / 2 days, or `3600` seconds / 1 hour).

    * **DNS Propagation:** Keep in mind that DNS changes can take some time to propagate across the internet. This process can range from a few minutes to up to 48 hours, although it is often much faster.

6.  **Wait for ACM Certificate Validation:**

    Once the DNS delegation is correctly configured, AWS ACM will automatically attempt to validate the SSL/TLS certificates for your domains using the DNS records created by Terraform. This validation process can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. You can monitor the status of your certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager console. The deployment of your CloudFront distribution (for the frontend) will typically wait for this certificate validation to complete.

7.  **Upload Website Content:**

    Navigate into the directory corresponding to your target environment. For example, if you want to upload to the integration environment, use:

    ```bash
    cd data_for_s3/integration
    ```

    Replace `<your_frontend_bucket_name>` with the actual name of the S3 bucket created by the `aws_frontend` module for this **specific environment** (e.g., `app.integration.yuriypikh.site-web`). You can find the bucket name in the Terraform state file or in the AWS S3 console after the deployment is complete.

    ```bash
    aws s3 cp index.html s3://<your_frontend_bucket_name>/index.html
    ```


8.  **Test Your Endpoints:**

    * **Frontend:** `https://<your_domain_name_app>` (e.g., `https://app.integration.yuriypikh.site`)
    * **Backend:** `https://<your_domain_name_api>` (e.g., `https://api.integration.yuriypikh.site`). 

9. **To Destroy the Infrastructure (for an environment):**

    ```bash
    cd environments/integration # Or staging/prod
    terraform destroy -auto-approve"
    ```

    Remember to remove/revert the NS record changes at your domain registrar if you destroy the infrastructure and no longer want AWS to manage DNS for those domains.
